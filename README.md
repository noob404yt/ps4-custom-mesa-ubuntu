# Custom Mesa for PS4 running Ubuntu and Ubuntu-based distros
This custom-built Mesa fixes image distortion on many games like Cyberpunk running on PS4 (PlayStation 4) through WIne, especially on the latest versions of Ubuntu.

## Using the custom Mesa script on PS4 Ubuntu
1. Open terminal and run `sudo apt install libz3-4`
2. Download the latest .tar.xz and .sh from the Releases section.
3. Extract the archive into the folder - /home/noob404/. If your distro doesn't have one, make the folder - noob404 with proper permissions.
4. Open terminal and run `source mesa.sh` and make sure you change the path of the mesa.sh according to your location. 
5. Run wine or any other launcher command on the same terminal to launch your game.
